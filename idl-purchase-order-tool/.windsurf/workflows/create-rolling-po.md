Steps

Step 1: Initiate Rolling P/O

Enter Vendor Information, Project, and Ceiling Amount

Optionally add initial item batch

Tag as Rolling P/O for system tracking

Step 2: Validate and Approve

Ensure Ceiling Amount is defined

Require approval from Supervisor or PM regardless of starting value

Step 3: Generate P/O

Assign P/O ID using format YYJJJ-PO-XYZ-RN

Log ceiling and remaining balance in the system

Step 4: Track Usage

Deduct from balance with each drawdown

Alert when balance is below threshold (e.g., 10%)

Step 5: Close Rolling P/O

PM or Admin manually closes the P/O when fully used or expired

Archive usage history and final balance

Notes

Approval is always required

System logs each transaction against the ceiling

Closing requires manual action and record confirmation
