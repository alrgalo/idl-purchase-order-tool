**P/O Generation: Critical Fields**

**Header Information:**

- IDL Project Number & Name
- Project Location
- Delivery Date/Date Required
- F.O.B. Point
- P/O Issue Date
- IDL Purchaser Name
- Vendor Name, Address, Contact Information
  - Should be an option to prepopulate from active vendor list or manually infill. Populate from 18 month rolling vendor list in timberline?
  - Contact email for vendor should be mandatory for automating workflow but may not be available in all cases – this is a field that should be prompted for before confirming and sending P/O

**Purchase Information:** (mandatory fields for each line item)

- Item Description
- Quantity
- Unit of Measure (UoM)
- Cost Code
  - Based on job number selected should be limited to active cost codes for the project
  - Need weekend workflow for instances where cost code has not made it to JobCost yet. Suggest can be left blank with requirement for PM to provide cost code within 48 hrs notification should be sent to PM and purchaser notified that PM will be required to provide cost code
  - Need to include an apply to all function as multiple lines may all go to the same cost code
- Category – Limit to LA, EQ, MA, SC (Labour, Equipment, Material, Subs)
  - \[Internal – do we want more, I prefer limiting to these 4\]
- Unit Price
  - Nice to have but not mandatory – flag if line item is PST eligible or not. Will help to auto-calc totals accurately
- Context – Provide an area for notes
  - Not a mandatory field but useful for P/O going to vendor to include site contact name and phone number for example or notice period before arrival (i.e. call Mitch 24 hours prior to arrival to ensure resources are available for offload)
    - Should include prompts so that purchaser knows what to do with this section (ex. parts for 470 cylinder rebuild – helps in approval process as many OEM vendors list and quote by part number making the invoice and P/O hard to interpret without the purchaser, this introduces another interface that slows the process as it often requires follow up calls etc.)
  - Internal Note Section
    - Mandatory if cost code is left blank or contact email is left blank – ensures some accountability from purchaser if they are not filling out mandatory fields.

**Signatures**

- Purchaser Signature
- Vendor Signature

**Job-Cost Interface for Operations**

1. **Initializing Project – New Project Information Sheets**

- New budget information sheet is sent to [JobCost@idlprojects.com](mailto:JobCost@idlprojects.com) with pertinent project information. This is a PDF form. Samples attached.
- Form received by JobCost – Job Number Issued to requester

\[Job Numbering System\]

1. **Budget Upload**

- PM Receives job number and issues budget complete with cost codes and categories to <Jobcost@idlprojects.com>
  - Where possible budgets should include quantities and UoM

1. **Cost Code Request**

- Projects undergo frequent change – PM (or designate) request new codes occasionally to either split budget into more detail or add new codes to reflect scope changes (17-XXX codes)
- PM assigns code but needs it to be in timberline to code costs against it, this is a manual add

\[Future buildout potential – can we develop a JC interface to pull costing and project cost info from timberline and have a PM interface for job costing rather than having a series of worksheets and different methods across projects and PMs? This is unrelated to the current objective but if we are building a JC piece looking at future potential\]

**Approvals Interface**

Next section of workflow buildout so this section is not exhaustive but highlighted in brief to underscore important aspects of P/O Generation & Invoice Intake

1. P/O Generated per above workflow
2. Invoice Received and ingested into AP workflow
3. Invoices reviewed and approved by Project Manager

Approval Process

- PM Reviews Cost Coding and category by line item
  - Accurate P/O information is critical to ensuring AP can pre-code the invoice this simplifies review process and minimizes recodes/reversals in accounting software
- PM Validates costs against quote
- PM Validates quantities against MRR (if available)

Challenges for Approvals

- Improper coding or lack of information on P/O
- Reviewing anticipated rate against billed rate sloes the review process considerably to the extent that this is often not done at all if no quote is included with P/O as it requires approver to dig around job folders for quote
- P/Os and Invoices that are based entirely on part numbers making it hard to distinguish what has actually been purchased and what the function is (most often with OEM vendors for equipment GET etc.)
- Manual process reviewing and approving as pdfs and refiling – tedious for large amounts of invoices
